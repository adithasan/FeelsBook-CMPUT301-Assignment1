# FeelsBook-CMPUT301-Assignment1
This is an android app I created for my Introduction to Software Engineering Course (CMPUT 301)


Please refer to the UML diagrams in the /doc folder for a general overview of design.

There are a number of unimplemented features as of Friday, Oct 5 2018, 12:21PM.

1. The ability to add comments to the feelings. (The Feeling class has architecture in place to accomodate it but behaviour in terms of activities haven't been implemented yet)
2. The ability to edit/delete feelings
